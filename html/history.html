            <p id="historyText">Romanticism was first defined as an aesthetic in literary criticism and slowly influenced artists, creating the artistic movement in France and Britain. The movement lasted from 1790 to 1850. The art movement was originally polarized by the public, where the work of early Romanticism embodied disorder and tumult– a major contrast to the values of reason and order during the Enlightenment era. Founding creators of romanticism include Baron Antoine Jean Gros, Anne Louis Girodet-Trioson, and Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Romanticism emphasizes the individual, the subjective, the irrational, and imaginative. Nature was a large muse at the time, inspiring artists to think emotion over reason, focusing on passion and inner struggles– all subject matter that was not valued in the era of enlightenment. Creative spirit and exploration became important in comparison to formal rules and traditional procedures of art at the time. </p>

            <p id="historyText">Nature acted as a symbol for the psyche with its uncontrollable power, unpredictability, and chances of cataclysmic extremes. An example of this symbolism can be seen in the recurrences of shipwrecks, symbolising the struggle against the manifestation and power of nature. The interest in the individual and who is being represented in the paintings shifts as well. The change in subject matter reflects the emotional exploration done during the romanticism era, creating new dialogue and representation of minorities, professions and emotional states.</p>
